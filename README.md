# GetAPerson

This was my first ever real python project. I used tkinter for the first time to create a simple GUI. Data is saved in a txt file, which will be automatically created if needed. I created methods in python for the first time as well. I struggled a lot with the scope but managed to make a working program.

# What is “GetAPerson” good for and how does it work?

You can add different categories. For every category you can add different persons, with different names (for example their gaming tags). You can then choose a category and the program will give you a random person from the chosen category. If you enter the same name in different categories but different tags/special names, they will be combined in the output.

I personally would use this to decide who I could catch up with today or who I should ask to play a video game with me.
